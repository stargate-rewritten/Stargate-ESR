  Are you connected to a bungee-compatible proxy?
  Set this value to true if you intend on building gates with the 'u' flag.

comment_default-gate-network: |
  What network will be used when none has been specified? (Max length 12 characters)
 
  Note that this primarily applies to users with the stargate.create.network node.
  Generally, that node is given to staff (we recommend stargate.create.personal for users).

  What is the maximum number of gates a single network may contain? (0 for unlimited)
  _endOfComment_

comment_handleVehicles: |
  Will vehicles and their passengers be able to travel through StarGate portals?
   [minecarts, boats, & saddled mobs = vehicles | players & mobs = passengers]
  
  …««»»…  This feature is partially incompatible with MineCraft 1.9+.
  “NOTE”  There is a planned fix for this in the upcoming SG rewrite (for MC 1.18+).

handleVehicles: true

comment_verifyPortals: |
  Will the server reverify all existing portals on startup?
 
  This checks that the expected gates are both present and using a valid layout.
  Designed to catch .gate file modifications, world changes, and terrain regeneration.
 
  …««»»…  If you set this to true, you should also set ignoreEntrance (below) to true!
  “NOTE”  Otherwise, disallowed players, block updates, and snowmen can invalidate your portals!
  _endOfComment_
verifyPortals: false

comment_ignoreEntrance: |
  Should the portal verification process account for 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 (open/closed) materials?
  ie. will a gate still validate if its portal-open material isn't present?
 
  When disabled, this setting makes gate validation more comprehensive;
  𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 blocks will no longer be able to overwrite existing blocks.
  _endOfComment_
ignoreEntrance: false

comment_protectEntrance: |
  SG protects gate 𝑓𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒 materials; should it also protect gate 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 (open/closed) materials?
  ex. in nether.gate, should nether_portal be protected?
 
  …««»»…  This feature can be somewhat resource intensive when active!
  “NOTE”  Only enable this if you use breakable 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 materials.

comment_taxaccount: |
  Does your server have a tax account (closed economy)?
  If so, please provide the name of your tax account (collected money will be sent to it).
  If not, leave this section blank (collected money will be deleted).
 
  Note that usecost money is excluded from this system when toowner is true.
