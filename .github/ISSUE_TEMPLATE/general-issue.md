> You are using the Extended Support Releases (ESR) Issues tracker.
> If you issue applies to a fully supported (modern) stargate release, please use [this](https://sgrewritten.org/report) tracker instead.

> ESR versions (<1.17) are MINIMALLY SUPPORTED, and are generally not recommended.
> Instead, we *strongly* recommend switching to our latest builds, found [here](https://sgrewritten.org/download).

**If your problem CRITICALLY impacts a Stargate ESR release (i.e. major dupes, exploits, etc.), please report it [USING THIS LINK](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-ESR/security/advisories/new)**
*Problems of the above category will be addressed by the Stargate team as part of the ESR program*.

**For all other problems, please describe your issue below including its versions and reproduction steps:**
*General issues will appear in the Issues tab, but will not be officially addressed; ESR versions do, however, remain open to pull requests.*
